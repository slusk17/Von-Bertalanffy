Growth generally refers to an individualâ€™s increase in either weight or length over time. Although there are numerous methods of evaluating growth, one of the most common methods is fitting a model to length at age data. The Bertalanffy growth curve is the most common model fit to length and age data is used to predict the length at a given age. The Von Bertalanffy growth curve is represented by:"),
